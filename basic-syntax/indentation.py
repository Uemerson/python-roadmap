# Python provides no braces to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions
# or flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced.

# The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block
# must be indented the same amount. Like:

if True:
    print("Correct Indentation")

print("Keeping correct Indentation")
