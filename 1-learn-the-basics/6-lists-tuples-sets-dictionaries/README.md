# Lists

Lists are just like dynamic sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java). Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it the most powerful tool in Python.

Let's see an example:

```
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

# Tuple

A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. In some ways, a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but a tuple is immutable, unlike lists that are mutable.

Let's see an example:

```
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```

# Set

A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements. Pythonâ€™s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set.

Let's see an example:

```
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
```

# Dictionary

In python, Dictionary is an ordered (since Py 3.7) [unordered (Py 3.6 & prior)] collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.

Let's see an example:

```
mydict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
```
