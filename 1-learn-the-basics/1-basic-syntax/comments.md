# About Comments in Python

A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal begins a comment. All characters after the # and up to the end of the physical line are part of the comment and the Python interpreter ignores them. For example:

```
# First comment
```

You can type a comment on the same line after a statement or expression, for example:

```
name = "Uemerson" # This is again comment
```

You can comment multiple lines as follows:

```
# This is a comment.
# This is a comment, too.
# This is a comment, too.
# I said that already.
```

Following triple-quoted string is also ignored by Python interpreter and can be used as a multiline comments:

```
'''
This is a multiline
comment.
'''
```
