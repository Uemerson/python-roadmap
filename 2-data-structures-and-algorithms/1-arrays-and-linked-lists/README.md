# Arrays and Linked lists

Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, resulting in easily calculable addresses for the elements stored and this allows faster access to an element at a specific index.

# Arrays

Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, resulting in easily calculable addresses for the elements stored and this allows faster access to an element at a specific index.

In the script [array](./scripts/array.py) has the representation of the array in Python

Output of [array](./scripts/array.py):

```
1 4 3
```

# Linked lists

Linked lists are less rigid in their storage structure and elements are usually not stored in contiguous locations, hence they need to be stored with additional tags giving a reference to the next element. This difference in the data storage scheme decides which data structure would be more suitable for a given situation.

In the script [Linked lists](./scripts/linked_lists.py) has the representation of the linked lists in Python

Output of [Linked lists](./scripts/linked_lists.py):

```
0
1
2
3
4
```
